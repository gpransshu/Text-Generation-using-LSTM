thou hast made me endless such is thy pleasure this frail vessel thou
emptiest again and again and fillest it ever with fresh life

this little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales and
hast breathed through it melodies eternally new

at the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in
joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable

thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine
ages pass and still thou pourest and still there is room to fill







when thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with
pride and i look to thy face and tears come to my eyes

all that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet
harmonyand my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight
across the sea

i know thou takest pleasure in my singing i know that only as a singer
i come before thy presence

i touch by the edge of the farspreading wing of my song thy feet which
i could never aspire to reach

drunk with the joy of singing i forget myself and call thee friend who
art my lord







i know not how thou singest my master i ever listen in silent
amazement

the light of thy music illumines the world the life breath of thy
music runs from sky to sky the holy stream of thy music breaks through
all stony obstacles and rushes on

my heart longs to join in thy song but vainly struggles for a voice i
would speak but speech breaks not into song and i cry out baffled
ah thou hast made my heart captive in the endless meshes of thy music
my master







life of my life i shall ever try to keep my body pure knowing that
thy living touch is upon all my limbs

i shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts knowing
that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my
mind

i shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my love
in flower knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my
heart

and it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions knowing it
is thy power gives me strength to act







i ask for a moments indulgence to sit by thy side the works that i
have in hand i will finish afterwards

away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite and
my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil

today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs and
the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering
grove

now it is time to sit quite face to face with thee and to sing
dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure







pluck this little flower and take it delay not i fear lest it droop
and drop into the dust

i may not find a place in thy garland but honour it with a touch of
pain from thy hand and pluck it i fear lest the day end before i am
aware and the time of offering go by

though its colour be not deep and its smell be faint use this flower
in thy service and pluck it while there is time







my song has put off her adornments she has no pride of dress and
decoration ornaments would mar our union they would come between thee
and me their jingling would drown thy whispers

my poets vanity dies in shame before thy sight o master poet i have
sat down at thy feet only let me make my life simple and straight
like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music







the child who is decked with princes robes and who has jewelled chains
round his neck loses all pleasure in his play his dress hampers him at
every step

in fear that it may be frayed or stained with dust he keeps himself
from the world and is afraid even to move

mother it is no gain thy bondage of finery if it keep one shut off
from the healthful dust of the earth if it rob one of the right of
entrance to the great fair of common human life







o fool try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders o beggar to come
beg at thy own door

leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all and never look
behind in regret

thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its
breath it is unholytake not thy gifts through its unclean hands
accept only what is offered by sacred love







here is thy footstool and there rest thy feet where live the poorest
and lowliest and lost

when i try to bow to thee my obeisance cannot reach down to the depth
where thy feet rest among the poorest and lowliest and lost

pride can never approach to where thou walkest in the clothes of the
humble among the poorest and lowliest and lost

my heart can never find its way to where thou keepest company with the
companionless among the poorest the lowliest and the lost







leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads whom dost thou
worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut
open thine eyes and see thy god is not before thee

he is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where the
pathmaker is breaking stones he is with them in sun and in shower and
his garment is covered with dust put of thy holy mantle and even like
him come down on the dusty soil

deliverance where is this deliverance to be found our master himself
has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation he is bound with us
all for ever

come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense
what harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained meet him
and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow







the time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long

i came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light and pursued my
voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a
star and planet

it is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself and that
training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a
tune

the traveller has to knock at every alien door to come to his own and
one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost
shrine at the end

my eyes strayed far and wide before i shut them and said here art
thou

the question and the cry oh where melt into tears of a thousand
streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance i am







the song that i came to sing remains unsung to this day

i have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument

the time has not come true the words have not been rightly set only
there is the agony of wishing in my heart

the blossom has not opened only the wind is sighing by

i have not seen his face nor have i listened to his voice only i have
heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house

the livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor but the
lamp has not been lit and i cannot ask him into my house

i live in the hope of meeting with him but this meeting is not yet







my desires are many and my cry is pitiful but ever didst thou save me
by hard refusals and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life
through and through

day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple great gifts that
thou gavest to me unaskedthis sky and the light this body and the
life and the mindsaving me from perils of overmuch desire

there are times when i languidly linger and times when i awaken and
hurry in search of my goal but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before
me

day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by refusing
me ever and anon saving me from perils of weak uncertain desire







i am here to sing thee songs in this hall of thine i have a corner
seat

in thy world i have no work to do my useless life can only break out
in tunes without a purpose

when the hour strikes for thy silent worship at the dark temple of
midnight command me my master to stand before thee to sing

when in the morning air the golden harp is tuned honour me commanding
my presence







i have had my invitation to this worlds festival and thus my life has
been blessed my eyes have seen and my ears have heard

it was my part at this feast to play upon my instrument and i have
done all i could

now i ask has the time come at last when i may go in and see thy face
and offer thee my silent salutation







i am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands
that is why it is so late and why i have been guilty of such omissions

they come with their laws and their codes to bind me fast but i evade
them ever for i am only waiting for love to give myself up at last
into his hands

people blame me and call me heedless i doubt not they are right in
their blame

the market day is over and work is all done for the busy those who
came to call me in vain have gone back in anger i am only waiting for
love to give myself up at last into his hands







clouds heap upon clouds and it darkens ah love why dost thou let me
wait outside at the door all alone

in the busy moments of the noontide work i am with the crowd but on
this dark lonely day it is only for thee that i hope

if thou showest me not thy face if thou leavest me wholly aside i
know not how i am to pass these long rainy hours

i keep gazing on the faraway gloom of the sky and my heart wanders
wailing with the restless wind







if thou speakest not i will fill my heart with thy silence and endure
it i will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil and its
head bent low with patience

the morning will surely come the darkness will vanish and thy voice
pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky

then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds
nests and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest
groves







on the day when the lotus bloomed alas my mind was straying and i
knew it not my basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded

only now and again a sadness fell upon me and i started up from my
dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind

that vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to
me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its
completion

i knew not then that it was so near that it was mine and that this
perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart







i must launch out my boat the languid hours pass by on the shorealas
for me

the spring has done its flowering and taken leave and now with the
burden of faded futile flowers i wait and linger

the waves have become clamorous and upon the bank in the shady lane
the yellow leaves flutter and fall

what emptiness do you gaze upon do you not feel a thrill passing
through the air with the notes of the faraway song floating from the
other shore







in the deep shadows of the rainy july with secret steps thou walkest
silent as night eluding all watchers

today the morning has closed its eyes heedless of the insistent calls
of the loud east wind and a thick veil has been drawn over the
everwakeful blue sky

the woodlands have hushed their songs and doors are all shut at every
house thou art the solitary wayfarer in this deserted street oh my
only friend my best beloved the gates are open in my housedo not
pass by like a dream







art thou abroad on this stormy night on thy journey of love my friend
the sky groans like one in despair

i have no sleep tonight ever and again i open my door and look out on
the darkness my friend

i can see nothing before me i wonder where lies thy path

by what dim shore of the inkblack river by what far edge of the
frowning forest through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading
thy course to come to me my friend







if the day is done if birds sing no more if the wind has flagged
tired then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me even as thou hast
wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep and tenderly closed the
petals of the drooping lotus at dusk

from the traveller whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage
is ended whose garment is torn and dustladen whose strength is
exhausted remove shame and poverty and renew his life like a flower
under the cover of thy kindly night







in the night of weariness let me give myself up to sleep without
struggle resting my trust upon thee

let me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy
worship

it is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day
to renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening







he came and sat by my side but i woke not what a cursed sleep it was
o miserable me

he came when the night was still he had his harp in his hands and my
dreams became resonant with its melodies

alas why are my nights all thus lost ah why do i ever miss his sight
whose breath touches my sleep







light oh where is the light kindle it with the burning fire of
desire

there is the lamp but never a flicker of a flameis such thy fate my
heart ah death were better by far for thee

misery knocks at thy door and her message is that thy lord is wakeful
and he calls thee to the lovetryst through the darkness of night

the sky is overcast with clouds and the rain is ceaseless i know not
what this is that stirs in mei know not its meaning

a moments flash of lightning drags down a deeper gloom on my sight
and my heart gropes for the path to where the music of the night calls
me

light oh where is the light kindle it with the burning fire of
desire it thunders and the wind rushes screaming through the void the
night is black as a black stone let not the hours pass by in the dark
kindle the lamp of love with thy life







obstinate are the trammels but my heart aches when i try to break
them

freedom is all i want but to hope for it i feel ashamed

i am certain that priceless wealth is in thee and that thou art my
best friend but i have not the heart to sweep away the tinsel that
fills my room

the shroud that covers me is a shroud of dust and death i hate it yet
hug it in love

my debts are large my failures great my shame secret and heavy yet
when i come to ask for my good i quake in fear lest my prayer be
granted







he whom i enclose with my name is weeping in this dungeon i am ever
busy building this wall all around and as this wall goes up into the
sky day by day i lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow

i take pride in this great wall and i plaster it with dust and sand
lest a least hole should be left in this name and for all the care i
take i lose sight of my true being







i came out alone on my way to my tryst but who is this that follows me
in the silent dark

i move aside to avoid his presence but i escape him not

he makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger he adds his
loud voice to every word that i utter

he is my own little self my lord he knows no shame but i am ashamed
to come to thy door in his company







prisoner tell me who was it that bound you

it was my master said the prisoner i thought i could outdo
everybody in the world in wealth and power and i amassed in my own
treasurehouse the money due to my king when sleep overcame me i lay
upon the bed that was for my lord and on waking up i found i was a
prisoner in my own treasurehouse

prisoner tell me who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain

it was i said the prisoner who forged this chain very carefully i
thought my invincible power would hold the world captive leaving me in
a freedom undisturbed thus night and day i worked at the chain with
huge fires and cruel hard strokes when at last the work was done and
the links were complete and unbreakable i found that it held me in its
grip







by all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world but
it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs and thou
keepest me free

lest i forget them they never venture to leave me alone but day passes
by after day and thou art not seen

if i call not thee in my prayers if i keep not thee in my heart thy
love for me still waits for my love







when it was day they came into my house and said we shall only take
the smallest room here

they said we shall help you in the worship of your god and humbly
accept only our own share in his grace and then they took their seat
in a corner and they sat quiet and meek

but in the darkness of night i find they break into my sacred shrine
strong and turbulent and snatch with unholy greed the offerings from
gods altar







let only that little be left of me whereby i may name thee my all

let only that little be left of my will whereby i may feel thee on
every side and come to thee in everything and offer to thee my love
every moment

let only that little be left of me whereby i may never hide thee

let only that little of my fetters be left whereby i am bound with thy
will and thy purpose is carried out in my lifeand that is the fetter
of thy love







where the mind is without fear and the head is held high

where knowledge is free

where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow
domestic walls

where words come out from the depth of truth

where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection

where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary
desert sand of dead habit

where the mind is led forward by thee into everwidening thought and
action

into that heaven of freedom my father let my country awake







this is my prayer to thee my lordstrike strike at the root of penury
in my heart

give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows

give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service

give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before
insolent might

give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles

and give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with
love







i thought that my voyage had come to its end at the last limit of my
powerthat the path before me was closed that provisions were
exhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity

but i find that thy will knows no end in me and when old words die out
on the tongue new melodies break forth from the heart and where the
old tracks are lost new country is revealed with its wonders







that i want thee only theelet my heart repeat without end all
desires that distract me day and night are false and empty to the
core

as the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light even
thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cryi want thee only
thee

as the storm still seeks its end in peace when it strikes against peace
with all its might even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love and
still its cry isi want thee only thee







when the heart is hard and parched up come upon me with a shower of
mercy

when grace is lost from life come with a burst of song

when tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from
beyond come to me my lord of silence with thy peace and rest

when my beggarly heart sits crouched shut up in a corner break open
the door my king and come with the ceremony of a king

when desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust o thou holy one
thou wakeful come with thy light and thy thunder







the rain has held back for days and days my god in my arid heart the
horizon is fiercely nakednot the thinnest cover of a soft cloud not
the vaguest hint of a distant cool shower

send thy angry storm dark with death if it is thy wish and with
lashes of lightning startle the sky from end to end

but call back my lord call back this pervading silent heat still and
keen and cruel burning the heart with dire despair

let the cloud of grace bend low from above like the tearful look of the
mother on the day of the fathers wrath







where dost thou stand behind them all my lover hiding thyself in the
shadows they push thee and pass thee by on the dusty road taking thee
for naught i wait here weary hours spreading my offerings for thee
while passersby come and take my flowers one by one and my basket is
nearly empty

the morning time is past and the noon in the shade of evening my eyes
are drowsy with sleep men going home glance at me and smile and fill
me with shame i sit like a beggar maid drawing my skirt over my face
and when they ask me what it is i want i drop my eyes and answer them
not

oh how indeed could i tell them that for thee i wait and that thou
hast promised to come how could i utter for shame that i keep for my
dowry this poverty ah i hug this pride in the secret of my heart

i sit on the grass and gaze upon the sky and dream of the sudden
splendour of thy comingall the lights ablaze golden pennons flying
over thy car and they at the roadside standing agape when they see
thee come down from thy seat to raise me from the dust and set at thy
side this ragged beggar girl atremble with shame and pride like a
creeper in a summer breeze

but time glides on and still no sound of the wheels of thy chariot
many a procession passes by with noise and shouts and glamour of glory
is it only thou who wouldst stand in the shadow silent and behind them
all and only i who would wait and weep and wear out my heart in vain
longing







early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat only
thou and i and never a soul in the world would know of this our
pilgrimage to no country and to no end

in that shoreless ocean at thy silently listening smile my songs would
swell in melodies free as waves free from all bondage of words

is the time not come yet are there works still to do lo the evening
has come down upon the shore and in the fading light the seabirds come
flying to their nests

who knows when the chains will be off and the boat like the last
glimmer of sunset vanish into the night







the day was when i did not keep myself in readiness for thee and
entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd unknown to
me my king thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a
fleeting moment of my life

and today when by chance i light upon them and see thy signature i
find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of joys
and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten

thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust and
the steps that i heard in my playroom are the same that are echoing
from star to star







this is my delight thus to wait and watch at the wayside where shadow
chases light and the rain comes in the wake of the summer

messengers with tidings from unknown skies greet me and speed along
the road my heart is glad within and the breath of the passing breeze
is sweet

from dawn till dusk i sit here before my door and i know that of a
sudden the happy moment will arrive when i shall see

in the meanwhile i smile and i sing all alone in the meanwhile the air
is filling with the perfume of promise







have you not heard his silent steps he comes comes ever comes

every moment and every age every day and every night he comes comes
ever comes

many a song have i sung in many a mood of mind but all their notes
have always proclaimed he comes comes ever comes

in the fragrant days of sunny april through the forest path he comes
comes ever comes

in the rainy gloom of july nights on the thundering chariot of clouds
he comes comes ever comes

in sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart and it
is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine







i know not from what distant time thou art ever coming nearer to meet
me thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye

in many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard and thy
messenger has come within my heart and called me in secret

i know not only why today my life is all astir and a feeling of
tremulous joy is passing through my heart

it is as if the time were come to wind up my work and i feel in the
air a faint smell of thy sweet presence







the night is nearly spent waiting for him in vain i fear lest in the
morning he suddenly come to my door when i have fallen asleep wearied
out oh friends leave the way open to him forbid him not

if the sounds of his steps does not wake me do not try to rouse me i
pray i wish not to be called from my sleep by the clamorous choir of
birds by the riot of wind at the festival of morning light let me
sleep undisturbed even if my lord comes of a sudden to my door

ah my sleep precious sleep which only waits for his touch to vanish
ah my closed eyes that would open their lids only to the light of his
smile when he stands before me like a dream emerging from darkness of
sleep

let him appear before my sight as the first of all lights and all
forms the first thrill of joy to my awakened soul let it come from his
glance and let my return to myself be immediate return to him







the morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs and the
flowers were all merry by the roadside and the wealth of gold was
scattered through the rift of the clouds while we busily went on our
way and paid no heed

we sang no glad songs nor played we went not to the village for
barter we spoke not a word nor smiled we lingered not on the way we
quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by

the sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade withered
leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon the shepherd boy
drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree and i laid myself
down by the water and stretched my tired limbs on the grass

my companions laughed at me in scorn they held their heads high and
hurried on they never looked back nor rested they vanished in the
distant blue haze they crossed many meadows and hills and passed
through strange faraway countries all honour to you heroic host of
the interminable path mockery and reproach pricked me to rise but
found no response in me i gave myself up for lost in the depth of a
glad humiliationin the shadow of a dim delight

the repose of the sunembroidered green gloom slowly spread over my
heart i forgot for what i had travelled and i surrendered my mind
without struggle to the maze of shadows and songs

at last when i woke from my slumber and opened my eyes i saw thee
standing by me flooding my sleep with thy smile how i had feared that
the path was long and wearisome and the struggle to reach thee was
hard







you came down from your throne and stood at my cottage door

i was singing all alone in a corner and the melody caught your ear
you came down and stood at my cottage door

masters are many in your hall and songs are sung there at all hours
but the simple carol of this novice struck at your love one plaintive
little strain mingled with the great music of the world and with a
flower for a prize you came down and stopped at my cottage door







i had gone abegging from door to door in the village path when thy
golden chariot appeared in the distance like a gorgeous dream and i
wondered who was this king of all kings

my hopes rose high and methought my evil days were at an end and i
stood waiting for alms to be given unasked and for wealth scattered on
all sides in the dust

the chariot stopped where i stood thy glance fell on me and thou
camest down with a smile i felt that the luck of my life had come at
last then of a sudden thou didst hold out thy right hand and say what
hast thou to give to me

ah what a kingly jest was it to open thy palm to a beggar to beg i
was confused and stood undecided and then from my wallet i slowly took
out the least little grain of corn and gave it to thee

but how great my surprise when at the days end i emptied my bag on the
floor to find a least little gram of gold among the poor heap i
bitterly wept and wished that i had had the heart to give thee my all







the night darkened our days works had been done we thought that the
last guest had arrived for the night and the doors in the village were
all shut only some said the king was to come we laughed and said no
it cannot be

it seemed there were knocks at the door and we said it was nothing but
the wind we put out the lamps and lay down to sleep only some said
it is the messenger we laughed and said no it must be the wind

there came a sound in the dead of the night we sleepily thought it was
the distant thunder the earth shook the walls rocked and it troubled
us in our sleep only some said it was the sound of wheels we said in
a drowsy murmur no it must be the rumbling of clouds

the night was still dark when the drum sounded the voice came wake
up delay not we pressed our hands on our hearts and shuddered with
fear some said lo there is the kings flag we stood up on our
feet and cried there is no time for delay

the king has comebut where are lights where are wreaths where is the
throne to seat him oh shame oh utter shame where is the hall the
decorations someone has said vain is this cry greet him with empty
hands lead him into thy rooms all bare

open the doors let the conchshells be sounded in the depth of the
night has come the king of our dark dreary house the thunder roars in
the sky the darkness shudders with lightning bring out thy tattered
piece of mat and spread it in the courtyard with the storm has come of
a sudden our king of the fearful night







i thought i should ask of theebut i dared notthe rose wreath thou
hadst on thy neck thus i waited for the morning when thou didst
depart to find a few fragments on the bed and like a beggar i
searched in the dawn only for a stray petal or two

ah me what is it i find what token left of thy love it is no flower
no spices no vase of perfumed water it is thy mighty sword flashing
as a flame heavy as a bolt of thunder the young light of morning
comes through the window and spreads itself upon thy bed the morning
bird twitters and asks woman what hast thou got no it is no
flower nor spices nor vase of perfumed waterit is thy dreadful
sword

i sit and muse in wonder what gift is this of thine i can find no
place to hide it i am ashamed to wear it frail as i am and it hurts
me when i press it to my bosom yet shall i bear in my heart this
honour of the burden of pain this gift of thine

from now there shall be no fear left for me in this world and thou
shalt be victorious in all my strife thou hast left death for my
companion and i shall crown him with my life thy sword is with me to
cut asunder my bonds and there shall be no fear left for me in the
world

from now i leave off all petty decorations lord of my heart no more
shall there be for me waiting and weeping in corners no more coyness
and sweetness of demeanour thou hast given me thy sword for adornment
no more dolls decorations for me







beautiful is thy wristlet decked with stars and cunningly wrought in
myriadcoloured jewels but more beautiful to me thy sword with its
curve of lightning like the outspread wings of the divine bird of
vishnu perfectly poised in the angry red light of the sunset

it quivers like the one last response of life in ecstasy of pain at the
final stroke of death it shines like the pure flame of being burning
up earthly sense with one fierce flash

beautiful is thy wristlet decked with starry gems but thy sword o
lord of thunder is wrought with uttermost beauty terrible to behold
or think of







i asked nothing from thee i uttered not my name to thine ear when
thou tookst thy leave i stood silent i was alone by the well where
the shadow of the tree fell aslant and the women had gone home with
their brown earthen pitchers full to the brim they called me and
shouted come with us the morning is wearing on to noon but i
languidly lingered awhile lost in the midst of vague musings

i heard not thy steps as thou camest thine eyes were sad when they
fell on me thy voice was tired as thou spokest lowah i am a thirsty
traveller i started up from my daydreams and poured water from my
jar on thy joined palms the leaves rustled overhead the cuckoo sang
from the unseen dark and perfume of babla flowers came from the bend
of the road

i stood speechless with shame when my name thou didst ask indeed what
had i done for thee to keep me in remembrance but the memory that i
could give water to thee to allay thy thirst will cling to my heart and
enfold it in sweetness the morning hour is late the bird sings in
weary notes neem leaves rustle overhead and i sit and think and
think







languor is upon your heart and the slumber is still on your eyes

has not the word come to you that the flower is reigning in splendour
among thorns wake oh awaken let not the time pass in vain

at the end of the stony path in the country of virgin solitude my
friend is sitting all alone deceive him not wake oh awaken

what if the sky pants and trembles with the heat of the midday sunwhat
if the burning sand spreads its mantle of thirst

is there no joy in the deep of your heart at every footfall of yours
will not the harp of the road break out in sweet music of pain







thus it is that thy joy in me is so full thus it is that thou hast
come down to me o thou lord of all heavens where would be thy love if
i were not

thou hast taken me as thy partner of all this wealth in my heart is
the endless play of thy delight in my life thy will is ever taking
shape

and for this thou who art the king of kings hast decked thyself in
beauty to captivate my heart and for this thy love loses itself in the
love of thy lover and there art thou seen in the perfect union of two







light my light the worldfilling light the eyekissing light
heartsweetening light

ah the light dances my darling at the centre of my life the light
strikes my darling the chords of my love the sky opens the wind
runs wild laughter passes over the earth

the butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light lilies and
jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light

the light is shattered into gold on every cloud my darling and it
scatters gems in profusion

mirth spreads from leaf to leaf my darling and gladness without
measure the heavens river has drowned its banks and the flood of joy
is abroad







let all the strains of joy mingle in my last songthe joy that makes
the earth flow over in the riotous excess of the grass the joy that
sets the twin brothers life and death dancing over the wide world
the joy that sweeps in with the tempest shaking and waking all life
with laughter the joy that sits still with its tears on the open red
lotus of pain and the joy that throws everything it has upon the dust
and knows not a word







yes i know this is nothing but thy love o beloved of my heart this
golden light that dances upon the leaves these idle clouds sailing
across the sky this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my
forehead

the morning light has flooded my eyesthis is thy message to my heart
thy face is bent from above thy eyes look down on my eyes and my
heart has touched thy feet







on the seashore of endless worlds children meet the infinite sky is
motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous on the
seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances

they build their houses with sand and they play with empty shells with
withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the
vast deep children have their play on the seashore of worlds

they know not how to swim they know not how to cast nets pearl
fishers dive for pearls merchants sail in their ships while children
gather pebbles and scatter them again they seek not for hidden
treasures they know not how to cast nets

the sea surges up with laughter and pale gleams the smile of the sea
beach deathdealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children
even like a mother while rocking her babys cradle the sea plays with
children and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach

on the seashore of endless worlds children meet tempest roams in the
pathless sky ships get wrecked in the trackless water death is abroad
and children play on the seashore of endless worlds is the great
meeting of children







the sleep that flits on babys eyesdoes anybody know from where it
comes yes there is a rumour that it has its dwelling there in the
fairy village among shadows of the forest dimly lit with glowworms
there hang two timid buds of enchantment from there it comes to kiss
babys eyes

the smile that flickers on babys lips when he sleepsdoes anybody know
where it was born yes there is a rumour that a young pale beam of a
crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn cloud and there
the smile was first born in the dream of a dewwashed morningthe smile
that flickers on babys lips when he sleeps

the sweet soft freshness that blooms on babys limbsdoes anybody know
where it was hidden so long yes when the mother was a young girl it
lay pervading her heart in tender and silent mystery of lovethe sweet
soft freshness that has bloomed on babys limbs







when i bring to you coloured toys my child i understand why there is
such a play of colours on clouds on water and why flowers are painted
in tintswhen i give coloured toys to you my child

when i sing to make you dance i truly now why there is music in leaves
and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening
earthwhen i sing to make you dance

when i bring sweet things to your greedy hands i know why there is
honey in the cup of the flowers and why fruits are secretly filled with
sweet juicewhen i bring sweet things to your greedy hands

when i kiss your face to make you smile my darling i surely
understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light and
what delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my
bodywhen i kiss you to make you smile







thou hast made me known to friends whom i knew not thou hast given me
seats in homes not my own thou hast brought the distant near and made
a brother of the stranger

i am uneasy at heart when i have to leave my accustomed shelter i
forget that there abides the old in the new and that there also thou
abidest

through birth and death in this world or in others wherever thou
leadest me it is thou the same the one companion of my endless life
who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar

when one knows thee then alien there is none then no door is shut
oh grant me my prayer that i may never lose the bliss of the touch of
the one in the play of many







on the slope of the desolate river among tall grasses i asked her
maiden where do you go shading your lamp with your mantle my house
is all dark and lonesomelend me your light she raised her dark eyes
for a moment and looked at my face through the dusk i have come to
the river she said to float my lamp on the stream when the daylight
wanes in the west i stood alone among tall grasses and watched the
timid flame of her lamp uselessly drifting in the tide

in the silence of gathering night i asked her maiden your lights are
all litthen where do you go with your lamp my house is all dark and
lonesomelend me your light she raised her dark eyes on my face and
stood for a moment doubtful i have come she said at last to
dedicate my lamp to the sky i stood and watched her light uselessly
burning in the void

in the moonless gloom of midnight i ask her maiden what is your
quest holding the lamp near your heart my house is all dark and
lonesomelend me your light she stopped for a minute and thought and
gazed at my face in the dark i have brought my light she said to
join the carnival of lamps i stood and watched her little lamp
uselessly lost among lights







what divine drink wouldst thou have my god from this overflowing cup
of my life

my poet is it thy delight to see thy creation through my eyes and to
stand at the portals of my ears silently to listen to thine own eternal
harmony

thy world is weaving words in my mind and thy joy is adding music to
them thou givest thyself to me in love and then feelest thine own
entire sweetness in me







she who ever had remained in the depth of my being in the twilight of
gleams and of glimpses she who never opened her veils in the morning
light will be my last gift to thee my god folded in my final song

words have wooed yet failed to win her persuasion has stretched to her
its eager arms in vain

i have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my
heart and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my
life

over my thoughts and actions my slumbers and dreams she reigned yet
dwelled alone and apart

many a man knocked at my door and asked for her and turned away in
despair

there was none in the world who ever saw her face to face and she
remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition







thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well

o thou beautiful there in the nest is thy love that encloses the soul
with colours and sounds and odours

there comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand
bearing the wreath of beauty silently to crown the earth

and there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds
through trackless paths carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden
pitcher from the western ocean of rest

but there where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her
flight in reigns the stainless white radiance there is no day nor
night nor form nor colour and never never a word







thy sunbeam comes upon this earth of mine with arms outstretched and
stands at my door the livelong day to carry back to thy feet clouds
made of my tears and sighs and songs

with fond delight thou wrappest about thy starry breast that mantle of
misty cloud turning it into numberless shapes and folds and colouring
it with hues everchanging

it is so light and so fleeting tender and tearful and dark that is
why thou lovest it o thou spotless and serene and that is why it may
cover thy awful white light with its pathetic shadows







the same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs
through the world and dances in rhythmic measures

it is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in
numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves
and flowers

it is the same life that is rocked in the oceancradle of birth and of
death in ebb and in flow

i feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life
and my pride is from the lifethrob of ages dancing in my blood this
moment







is it beyond thee to be glad with the gladness of this rhythm to be
tossed and lost and broken in the whirl of this fearful joy

all things rush on they stop not they look not behind no power can
hold them back they rush on

keeping steps with that restless rapid music seasons come dancing and
pass awaycolours tunes and perfumes pour in endless cascades in the
abounding joy that scatters and gives up and dies every moment







that i should make much of myself and turn it on all sides thus
casting coloured shadows on thy radiancesuch is thy maya

thou settest a barrier in thine own being and then callest thy severed
self in myriad notes this thy selfseparation has taken body in me

the poignant song is echoed through all the sky in manycoloured tears
and smiles alarms and hopes waves rise up and sink again dreams
break and form in me is thy own defeat of self

this screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures
with the brush of the night and the day behind it thy seat is woven in
wondrous mysteries of curves casting away all barren lines of
straightness

the great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky with the tune
of thee and me all the air is vibrant and all ages pass with the
hiding and seeking of thee and me







he it is the innermost one who awakens my being with his deep hidden
touches

he it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes and joyfully plays on
the chords of my heart in varied cadence of pleasure and pain

he it is who weaves the web of this maya in evanescent hues of gold
and silver blue and green and lets peep out through the folds his
feet at whose touch i forget myself

days come and ages pass and it is ever he who moves my heart in many a
name in many a guise in many a rapture of joy and of sorrow







deliverance is not for me in renunciation i feel the embrace of
freedom in a thousand bonds of delight

thou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various
colours and fragrance filling this earthen vessel to the brim

my world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame and
place them before the altar of thy temple

no i will never shut the doors of my senses the delights of sight and
hearing and touch will bear thy delight

yes all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy and all my
desires ripen into fruits of love







the day is no more the shadow is upon the earth it is time that i go
to the stream to fill my pitcher

the evening air is eager with the sad music of the water ah it calls
me out into the dusk in the lonely lane there is no passerby the
wind is up the ripples are rampant in the river

i know not if i shall come back home i know not whom i shall chance to
meet there at the fording in the little boat the unknown man plays
upon his lute







thy gifts to us mortals fulfil all our needs and yet run back to thee
undiminished

the river has its everyday work to do and hastens through fields and
hamlets yet its incessant stream winds towards the washing of thy
feet

the flower sweetens the air with its perfume yet its last service is
to offer itself to thee

thy worship does not impoverish the world

from the words of the poet men take what meanings please them yet
their last meaning points to thee







day after day o lord of my life shall i stand before thee face to
face with folded hands o lord of all worlds shall i stand before
thee face to face

under thy great sky in solitude and silence with humble heart shall i
stand before thee face to face

in this laborious world of thine tumultuous with toil and with
struggle among hurrying crowds shall i stand before thee face to face

and when my work shall be done in this world o king of kings alone
and speechless shall i stand before thee face to face







i know thee as my god and stand aparti do not know thee as my own and
come closer i know thee as my father and bow before thy feeti do not
grasp thy hand as my friends

i stand not where thou comest down and ownest thyself as mine there to
clasp thee to my heart and take thee as my comrade

thou art the brother amongst my brothers but i heed them not i divide
not my earnings with them thus sharing my all with thee

in pleasure and in pain i stand not by the side of men and thus stand
by thee i shrink to give up my life and thus do not plunge into the
great waters of life







when the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first
splendour the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang oh the
picture of perfection the joy unalloyed

but one cried of a suddenit seems that somewhere there is a break in
the chain of light and one of the stars has been lost

the golden string of their harp snapped their song stopped and they
cried in dismayyes that lost star was the best she was the glory of
all heavens

from that day the search is unceasing for her and the cry goes on from
one to the other that in her the world has lost its one joy

only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile and whisper among
themselvesvain is this seeking unbroken perfection is over all







if it is not my portion to meet thee in this life then let me ever feel
that i have missed thy sightlet me not forget for a moment let me
carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours

as my days pass in the crowded market of this world and my hands grow
full with the daily profits let me ever feel that i have gained
nothinglet me not forget for a moment let me carry the pangs of this
sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours

when i sit by the roadside tired and panting when i spread my bed low
in the dust let me ever feel that the long journey is still before
melet me not forget a moment let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in
my dreams and in my wakeful hours

when my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound and the
laughter there is loud let me ever feel that i have not invited thee
to my houselet me not forget for a moment let me carry the pangs of
this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours







i am like a remnant of a cloud of autumn uselessly roaming in the sky
o my sun everglorious thy touch has not yet melted my vapour making
me one with thy light and thus i count months and years separated from
thee

if this be thy wish and if this be thy play then take this fleeting
emptiness of mine paint it with colours gild it with gold float it
on the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders

and again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night i shall
melt and vanish away in the dark or it may be in a smile of the white
morning in a coolness of purity transparent







on many an idle day have i grieved over lost time but it is never
lost my lord thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own
hands

hidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts
buds into blossoms and ripening flowers into fruitfulness

i was tired and sleeping on my idle bed and imagined all work had
ceased in the morning i woke up and found my garden full with wonders
of flowers







time is endless in thy hands my lord there is none to count thy
minutes

days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers thou knowest
how to wait

thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower

we have no time to lose and having no time we must scramble for a
chances we are too poor to be late

and thus it is that time goes by while i give it to every querulous man
who claims it and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last

at the end of the day i hasten in fear lest thy gate to be shut but i
find that yet there is time







mother i shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck with my tears of
sorrow

the stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet but
mine will hang upon thy breast

wealth and fame come from thee and it is for thee to give or to
withhold them but this my sorrow is absolutely mine own and when i
bring it to thee as my offering thou rewardest me with thy grace







it is the pang of separation that spreads throughout the world and
gives birth to shapes innumerable in the infinite sky

it is this sorrow of separation that gazes in silence all nights from
star to star and becomes lyric among rustling leaves in rainy darkness
of july

it is this overspreading pain that deepens into loves and desires into
sufferings and joy in human homes and this it is that ever melts and
flows in songs through my poets heart







when the warriors came out first from their masters hall where had
they hid their power where were their armour and their arms

they looked poor and helpless and the arrows were showered upon them
on the day they came out from their masters hall

when the warriors marched back again to their masters hall where did
they hide their power

they had dropped the sword and dropped the bow and the arrow peace was
on their foreheads and they had left the fruits of their life behind
them on the day they marched back again to their masters hall







death thy servant is at my door he has crossed the unknown sea and
brought thy call to my home

the night is dark and my heart is fearfulyet i will take up the lamp
open my gates and bow to him my welcome it is thy messenger who stands
at my door

i will worship him placing at his feet the treasure of my heart

he will go back with his errand done leaving a dark shadow on my
morning and in my desolate home only my forlorn self will remain as my
last offering to thee







in desperate hope i go and search for her in all the corners of my
room i find her not

my house is small and what once has gone from it can never be regained

but infinite is thy mansion my lord and seeking her i have to come to
thy door

i stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky and i lift my
eager eyes to thy face

i have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanishno
hope no happiness no vision of a face seen through tears

oh dip my emptied life into that ocean plunge it into the deepest
fullness let me for once feel that lost sweet touch in the allness of
the universe







deity of the ruined temple the broken strings of vina sing no more
your praise the bells in the evening proclaim not your time of
worship the air is still and silent about you

in your desolate dwelling comes the vagrant spring breeze it brings
the tidings of flowersthe flowers that for your worship are offered no
more

your worshipper of old wanders ever longing for favour still refused
in the eventide when fires and shadows mingle with the gloom of dust
he wearily comes back to the ruined temple with hunger in his heart

many a festival day comes to you in silence deity of the ruined
temple many a night of worship goes away with lamp unlit

many new images are built by masters of cunning art and carried to the
holy stream of oblivion when their time is come

only the deity of the ruined temple remains unworshipped in deathless
neglect







no more noisy loud words from mesuch is my masters will henceforth
i deal in whispers the speech of my heart will be carried on in
murmurings of a song

men hasten to the kings market all the buyers and sellers are there
but i have my untimely leave in the middle of the day in the thick of
work

let then the flowers come out in my garden though it is not their
time and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum

full many an hour have i spent in the strife of the good and the evil
but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my
heart on to him and i know not why is this sudden call to what useless
inconsequence







on the day when death will knock at thy door what wilt thou offer to
him

oh i will set before my guest the full vessel of my lifei will never
let him go with empty hands

all the sweet vintage of all my autumn days and summer nights all the
earnings and gleanings of my busy life will i place before him at the
close of my days when death will knock at my door







o thou the last fulfilment of life death my death come and whisper
to me

day after day i have kept watch for thee for thee have i borne the
joys and pangs of life

all that i am that i have that i hope and all my love have ever
flowed towards thee in depth of secrecy one final glance from thine
eyes and my life will be ever thine own

the flowers have been woven and the garland is ready for the
bridegroom after the wedding the bride shall leave her home and meet
her lord alone in the solitude of night







i know that the day will come when my sight of this earth shall be
lost and life will take its leave in silence drawing the last curtain
over my eyes

yet stars will watch at night and morning rise as before and hours
heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains

when i think of this end of my moments the barrier of the moments
breaks and i see by the light of death thy world with its careless
treasures rare is its lowliest seat rare is its meanest of lives

things that i longed for in vain and things that i gotlet them pass
let me but truly possess the things that i ever spurned and overlooked







i have got my leave bid me farewell my brothers i bow to you all and
take my departure

here i give back the keys of my doorand i give up all claims to my
house i only ask for last kind words from you

we were neighbours for long but i received more than i could give now
the day has dawned and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out a
summons has come and i am ready for my journey







at this time of my parting wish me good luck my friends the sky is
flushed with the dawn and my path lies beautiful

ask not what i have with me to take there i start on my journey with
empty hands and expectant heart

i shall put on my wedding garland mine is not the redbrown dress of
the traveller and though there are dangers on the way i have no fear
in mind

the evening star will come out when my voyage is done and the plaintive
notes of the twilight melodies be struck up from the kings gateway







i was not aware of the moment when i first crossed the threshold of
this life

what was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a
bud in the forest at midnight

when in the morning i looked upon the light i felt in a moment that i
was no stranger in this world that the inscrutable without name and
form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother

even so in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me and
because i love this life i know i shall love death as well

the child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it
away in the very next moment to find in the left one its consolation







when i go from hence let this be my parting word that what i have seen
is unsurpassable

i have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus that expands on the
ocean of light and thus am i blessedlet this be my parting word

in this playhouse of infinite forms i have had my play and here have i
caught sight of him that is formless

my whole body and my limbs have thrilled with his touch who is beyond
touch and if the end comes here let it comelet this be my parting
word







when my play was with thee i never questioned who thou wert i knew nor
shyness nor fear my life was boisterous

in the early morning thou wouldst call me from my sleep like my own
comrade and lead me running from glade to glade

on those days i never cared to know the meaning of songs thou sangest
to me only my voice took up the tunes and my heart danced in their
cadence

now when the playtime is over what is this sudden sight that is come
upon me the world with eyes bent upon thy feet stands in awe with all
its silent stars







i will deck thee with trophies garlands of my defeat it is never in
my power to escape unconquered

i surely know my pride will go to the wall my life will burst its
bonds in exceeding pain and my empty heart will sob out in music like
a hollow reed and the stone will melt in tears

i surely know the hundred petals of a lotus will not remain closed for
ever and the secret recess of its honey will be bared

from the blue sky an eye shall gaze upon me and summon me in silence
nothing will be left for me nothing whatever and utter death shall i
receive at thy feet







when i give up the helm i know that the time has come for thee to take
it what there is to do will be instantly done vain is this struggle

then take away your hands and silently put up with your defeat my
heart and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still where you
are placed

these my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind and trying
to light them i forget all else again and again

but i shall be wise this time and wait in the dark spreading my mat on
the floor and whenever it is thy pleasure my lord come silently and
take thy seat here







i dive down into the depth of the ocean of forms hoping to gain the
perfect pearl of the formless

no more sailing from harbour to harbour with this my weatherbeaten
boat the days are long passed when my sport was to be tossed on waves

and now i am eager to die into the deathless

into the audience hall by the fathomless abyss where swells up the
music of toneless strings i shall take this harp of my life

i shall tune it to the notes of forever and when it has sobbed out its
last utterance lay down my silent harp at the feet of the silent







ever in my life have i sought thee with my songs it was they who led
me from door to door and with them have i felt about me searching and
touching my world

it was my songs that taught me all the lessons i ever learnt they
showed me secret paths they brought before my sight many a star on the
horizon of my heart

they guided me all the day long to the mysteries of the country of
pleasure and pain and at last to what palace gate have they brought
me in the evening at the end of my journey







i boasted among men that i had known you they see your pictures in all
works of mine they come and ask me who is he i know not how to
answer them i say indeed i cannot tell they blame me and they go
away in scorn and you sit there smiling

i put my tales of you into lasting songs the secret gushes out from my
heart they come and ask me tell me all your meanings i know not
how to answer them i say ah who knows what they mean they smile
and go away in utter scorn and you sit there smiling







in one salutation to thee my god let all my senses spread out and
touch this world at thy feet

like a raincloud of july hung low with its burden of unshed showers
let all my mind bend down at thy door in one salutation to thee

let all my songs gather together their diverse strains into a single
current and flow to a sea of silence in one salutation to thee

like a flock of homesick cranes flying night and day back to their
mountain nests let all my life take its voyage to its eternal home in
one salutation to thee
